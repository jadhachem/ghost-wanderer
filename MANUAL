Ghost Wanderer v0.0.3
by Jad Hachem


PRELIMINARIES
-------------

Before you read this manual, make sure you have installed and can run the program.
Installation instructions and requirements can be found in the README file.


GOAL OF THE GAME
----------------

You control a ghost that wanders around in a small, rectangular area.
There will constantly be other ghosts entering the area, and your ghost has to avoid them.
The goal of the game is to last as long as possible before hitting a hostile ghost.


TYPES OF GHOSTS
---------------

As of v0.0.3, there are three types of ghosts.
Each type is identifiable by its color.
The most important property of each non-player ghost is its "Bump Event",
which denotes what happens when it bumps into the player's ghost.

* Player ghost
	- Color: White
	- Controlled by the player
	- Bounces at the edges of the area

* Regular hostile ghost
	- Color: Magenta
	- Bump Event: Game ends
	- Once it enters the area, it wanders around at a fixed speed.
	  When it reaches the edge of the area, it bounces back.

* Jack ghost
	- Color: Cyan
	- Bump Event: All non-player ghosts are immediately removed from the area
	- When this ghost enters the area, it goes in a straight line
	  until it exits out one of the edges.

* Berserk ghost
	- Color: Rapid alternation between Yellow and Blue
	- Bump Event: Game ends
	- Once this ghost enters, it follows the player ghost for a fixed amount
	  of time, after which it abandons the chase and leaves the area

The Berserk ghost is still an experimental feature.


MOVEMENT
--------

The player ghost is controlled using the arrow keys.
At the start of the game, the ghost has a randomly-chosen velocity.
Each press of an arrow key increments the velocity in the corresponding direction by a fixed amount (possibly reversing the direction).
Note that the game is designed such that the ghost never reaches a full stop.


HOW THE GAME WORKS
------------------

The game starts with the player ghost alone in a rectangular area.
After 5 seconds, the first wave begins.
Each wave starts with 10 hostile ghosts entering the arena randomly.
For every 5 seconds after that, a new ghost enters the area.
This ghost will likely be another hostile ghost,
but it can be one of the other "special" ghosts, with some small probability.
The game ends when the player ghost hits a hostile ghost.

Once a hostile ghost enters the area, it will never leave it by any normal means.
This means that, over time, the area becomes crowded with hostile ghosts, which the player has to keep avoiding.
However, when a Jack ghost is caught, all non-player ghosts in the area are immediately cleared.
This buys the player some time.

But catching a Jack ghost also has its downsides!
First, the average speed of all the future non-player ghosts increases, making avoiding them even harder!
Second, the probability of a Jack ghost entering the area decreases to 75% of its previous value.
But don't worry!
It will increase again as more and more ghosts enter the area.

Once a Jack ghost is caught, a new wave begins.
Each wave is harder than the previous!


CUSTOMIZING THE GAME
--------------------

This program is still in its early stages.
As a result, it does not have any friendly interface with which the user can customize their game.
This is still possible though, by modifying the values of certain variables in the source code.

These variables are located in the file:
	src/ghost_factory.cpp
inside the anonymous namespace near the top of the code.
The code must be recompiled when these parameters are modified in order to incorporate the changes into the game.
